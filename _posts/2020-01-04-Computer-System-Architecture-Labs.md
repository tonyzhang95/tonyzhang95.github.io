### Computer System Architecture Labs

The lab is a simulation of a pipelined MIPS processor with C++ as part of my school project. The code simulates basic pipelined processor components including memory, registers, ALU, and output mechanism, and supports throughput-improving techniques such as stalling, forwarding. This simulation is five-staged: Instruction Fetching (IF), Instructions Decode (ID), Execution (EX), Memory (MEM), Write Back (WB).
Code and specification can be found [here]().
