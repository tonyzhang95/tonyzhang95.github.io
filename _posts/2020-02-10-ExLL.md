###ExLL: An Extremely Low-latency Congestion Control for Mobile Cellular Networks

###Intro

+ Data latency: devastating effect on applications, such as self-driving cars, autonomous robots, and remote surgery (5G apps)

+ TCP sessions often have long delay: **buffer-float**: over-buffering problem at bottleneck link because of TCP's loose congestion control
+ More paper confirming **buffer-float is** **severe in cellular network**

Cellular Network Characteristics for Protocol Design:

+ Downlink Scheduling: the base station (BS) schedules downlink packets towards multiple user equipments (UEs) at 1 ms granularity (a.k.a. transmission time interval, TTI), based on both the signal strength reported by each UE and the current traffic load -> **Infer cellular link bandwidth instantly with reception pattern** rather than explicitly probing for bandwidth or measuring for a long period of time
+ Uplink Scheduling: (the BS needs to grant uplink transmission eligibility for each UE, which happens at a regular interval known as SR (scheduling request) periodicity) **Ignoring this periodicity -> underestimate minimum RTT -> CC to run in unrealistic operating conditions**.
+ **Minimum RTT is not affected by channel condition between UR and BS** (due to adaptive MCS (modulation and coding scheme) selection used in LTE systems, which approximately eliminates MAC-layer retransmissions, but also not affected by other UEs connected to the same BS since per-UE queue is isolated)

Existing Protocols:

​	Testing done with Android phones and LTE connections

+ Low latency and throughput can't be achieved together

+ ExLL:
  + Target: **Low latency** with **high throughput**
  + Estimations done at UE -> ExLL a **receiver-drive** CC
  + Estimates bandwidth of links by analyzing packet **reception pattern** in downlink
  + Estimates min RTT with **SR periodicity** in uplink
  + Uses control feedback from FAST for receive winding **RWND**
  + Server set its congestion window, CWND, upon RWND from receiver -> **immediately deployable**
  + ExLL can be sender-drive, small performance gap

+ Max throughput and min RTT:

  + Moving device (change in RSSI, signal strength): stable RTT, unstable throughput

+ Min RTT over different RSSI values:

  + Min RTT not much affected by RSSI values

+ Per-UE queue:
  + Per-UE queue is important because delay in one UE will not affect other devices in the same Base Station (BS).

### ExLL's Network Inference

+ Downlink: efficient probing is thought to be important

  + Challenge: injecting packets that causes network over-buffering to probe bandwidth is bad for latency

  + Solutions:

    + Extracting physical layer parameters
      + Only supported by specific vendors
      + Needs software tools needing rooting a device
    + Machine Learning
      + Takes time to learn and respond -> latency in response to traffic load/channel condition change
    + ExLL: **estimates bandwidth rather than probing**

  + Scheduling Pattern

    + ![Screen Shot 2020-02-08 at 03.56.55](/Users/Zibo/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Screen Shot 2020-02-08 at 03.56.55.png)
    + Figure 4 (a): At initial stage, the number of received packets in a radio frame increases rapidly as CWND increases -> downlink behavior temporarily depends on CWND growth
    + ![Screen Shot 2020-02-08 at 03.57.16](/Users/Zibo/Pictures/Screenshots/Screen Shot 2020-02-08 at 03.57.16.png)
    + Figure 4 (b): the patterns of allocated subframes change, but the total number of packet receptions per radio frame becomes stable ( N(f) = 159, 162, 167 )

  + Downlink bandwidth estimation

    + F(·): packet reception during one radio frame (received bytes in one radio frame / 10 ms)
    + C(·): estimation of max bandwidth (before splitting for UEs)

    + F(·) ≈ Measured throughput
    + C(·)~(a)~ ≈ 300 Mbps (30 MHz capacity), C(·)~(b)~ ≈ 400 Mbps (40 MHz capacity)
    + Poor channel condition is detected & C(·) is adjusted in (a) at t = 14s

  + Granularity of (a) is ~ 1ms, (b) is ~ 10ms -> SR (scheduling request) periodicity for uplink is 10ms.
  + CDF (cumulative density function) of RTT, 37 - 47 ms, avg = 42 ms, max - min = 10ms = SR periodicity
  + Challenge: use min RTT as measurement or target for controlling CWND -> conservative, loss throughput
    + Solution: new estimation technique that incorporates SR periodicity.

### ExLL Design

+ Control Algorithm

  + Based on FAST control equation:

    ​	$$ w_{i+1} = (i - \gamma)w_i + \gamma(\frac{mRE_i}{R_i}w_i + \alpha)$$

    + $$ \gamma \in (0,1] , \alpha > 0, w_i \ , \ R_i \ , \ mER_i \ is \ CWND, \ RTT, minimum \ RTT \ estimate \ at \ i$$

    + CWND grows at constant factor: $\alpha$

    + $\alpha$ determines the amount of queueing in the bottleneck of a flow, which accumulates for multiple flows, the agility of bandwidth adaptation, and the robustness in maintaining high throughput (**many inherent trade-offs**)

    + Example: small $\alpha$

      | Pros                     | Cons                                                         |
      | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
      | small queue, low latency | slow adaption, RTT fluctuation -> -> over reduce CWND -> empty queue -> less throughput |

  + ExLL solves the above trade-offs by

    $$ \alpha \to \alpha(1-\frac{T_i}{MTE_i})$$

  + $T_i$, $MTE_i$ is measured throughput, maximum throughput estimate at time i

    $$ w_{i+1} = (i - \gamma)w_i + \gamma(\frac{mRE_i}{R_i}w_i + \alpha(1-\frac{T_i}{MTE_i}))$$    Eq.3

  + Large $\alpha$ : agile and robust bandwidth probing + no over buffering at bottleneck link, because growth factor $\alpha(1-\frac{T_i}{MTE_i}) \to 0$ as $ T_i \to MTEi$

+ State Transition (workflow) receiver-driven![Screen Shot 2020-02-10 at 14.00.50](/Users/Zibo/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Screen Shot 2020-02-10 at 14.00.50.png)

  + *Observation mode*

    + When Cubic's CWND <= bandwidth estimate

  + *Control mode*

    + When Cubic's CWND > bandwidth estimate
      + report RWND, compute w~i+1~, send back to server

  + *Recovery logic* (more on this later)

    + Packet loss or CWND reduced <= RWND
      + Store RWND value, stop updating RWND until CWND >= RWND again

    + Cubic reset
      + Restart ExLL from observation mode

+ Sender-driven: plug-in for Cubic![Screen Shot 2020-02-10 at 14.01.13](/Users/Zibo/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Screen Shot 2020-02-10 at 14.01.13.png)

  + ExLL Control mode
    + When $$\frac{cwnd^C}{mRE_S} > MTE_S $$
      + Calculate $cwnd^E_i$ from Eq.3
      + Overrides Cubic when $cwnd^E < cwnd^C$

+ MTE calculation

  + F (·) is updated per radio frame = 10ms, much fast than sender's information delayed by RTT ~ 40+ ms.
  + Sender-drive: $MTE_S = \frac{cwnd}{\Delta t}$ , where $\Delta t = t_{last Ack} - t_{first Ack}$, small difference in actual experiment measurements

+ mRE calculation

  + Observation: track minimum, average RTT per packet with *mpRTT*, *apRTT*

  + Control

    + $mRE = mpRTT + D(2*(apRTT - mpRTT))$

    Where D() finds matching SR periodicity in (5, 10, 20, 40, 80) from

    $\hat T^{SR} = 2*(apRTT-mpRTT)$

    + Experiment: a eNB that uses SR periodicity of 10ms ≈ $\hat T^{SR}$

    + eNBs with 10, 20, 30 ms SR periodicity

+  Recovery from loss or timeout

  + CWND reduced to < RWND for packet loss
    + Store RWND value, stop updating RWND until CWND >= RWND again

  + Cubic resets, CWND = default initial CWND, for timeout
    + Restart ExLL from observation mode

+ Incorporate the control logic of FAST into ExLL to minimize the latency even in dynamic cellular channel conditions.
+ Implement ExLL in both receiver- and sender-side versions that give wider deployment opportunities. The receiver-side ExLL can provide an immediate solution for untouched commodity servers while the sender-side ExLL can provide a fundamental solution for 5G URLLC (ultra reliability and low latency communication).
