## SMORE

#### Intro: Problems

+ current TE focuses on performance or robustness, not both
+ goal: good performance and failure tolerance.
+ *oblivious routing* algorithm
  + low-stretch, diverse, naturally load-balancing
+ dynamically adjust sending rates
+ combination is powerful and novel

#### FE System Study

+ FE components

  + which path to take: path selection, slow -> infrequent
  + how much traffic: rate adaptation, fast -> continuous
  + challenge: to select small set of paths, to flexibly handle traffic scenarios.

+ Path properties metrics

  + low-stretch: low latency
  + high diversity: good robustness
  + good balancing: better performance
  + good design needs to be capacity aware (not to over-utilize low-capacity links) & globally optimized (considers all pairs simultaneously)

#### SMORE Design

+ **Oblivious routing** by Racke's [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1374376.1374415) : a system of optional paths is chosen in advance for every source-destination pair, and every packet for that pair must travel along one of these optional paths, without consideration for demand.

  + Why oblivious? To anticipate demands is challenging, and time consuming. Actual condition may differ a lot from anticipation. Avoids overfitting -> naturally robust.
  + Routing tree / decomposition tree: In each iteration, algorithm generates a new routing tree with approximation algorithm --> low-stretch; updates weights of each link based on its capacity and cumulative utilization in the previous tree (penalize further use of already heavily utilized links) --> load-balancing; randomized intermediate destinations --> diversity.

+ **Rate Adaption**: computes updated value of path weights by minimizing MLU (max link util) using a *Linear Program*, LP.

  + paths are fixed --> LP computation is fast

+ lighter congestions
+ no over-subscription for SMORE, whereas ECMP can over-subscribe 100X.
+ latency is competitive with others

+ SMORE overall
  + low congestion loss (red → 0)
  + high throughput (black → 1)
+ (a) SMORE's MLU performance (green) is greatly better other's, and competitive to Optimal (using MCF, multi-commodity flow, to minimize MLU) which has the following cons:
  + Solving MCF is slow thus limit responsiveness to changing demands. On average 25s for an optimized LP solver to solve MCF instances for a WAN.
  + Small changes in TMs (traffic matrix) can lead to a significantly different solution to MCF, which leads to excessive routing churn.
  + Ensuring continuous consistent updates to forwarding state at routers adds significant management complexity.
+ (b) SMORE is also robust (tolerant to failures): failure losses (blue on the bottom next to zero) is minimal and stable
