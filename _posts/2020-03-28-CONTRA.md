### CONTRA

#### Motivation

In order to achieve efficient routing protocols, a system should supports:

+ Traffic Engineering: prefer least utilized paths
+ Routing Constraints: middle-box traversal, specifying certain routes
+ Fast Adaption: update routing upon condition change

Conga/Hula: supports only least utilized path policy, not RC and not for arbitrary topology (only uses tree-like topo)

Contra: performance aware, programmable, general (for wide range of policies and topologies)

High level view:

Contra compiles high level policies into performance-aware routing protocols in data plane



#### Language

Path constraints are defined with regular expression, metric

Example: S can use F1/F2 with least util to reach D, drop for other path

Sample language to map **paths** to **ranks** based on their performance





#### Policies

Widest Shortest Path: least utilized path among shortest paths

Source-local preference: regular expression to specify paths



#### Compilation using [Merlin](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/merlin.pdf) (a language for provisioning network resources)

1. Automata are generated from policies. (b)&(c)

2. Intermedia representation (product graph) is generated with automata, checked with actual topology (d)

3. forwarding tables are populated during runtime (e) when probes arrive carrying information on the pathway (metrics, next hop switch)
4. Synthesize P4 programs to track policy states during runtime

**Product Graph**

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Contra/Screen Shot 2020-03-28 at 14.01.53.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-03-28 at 14.01.53" style="zoom:50%;" />

Policy -> automata + topology = Product Graph

Each PG edge is a **policy-compliant path** for the topology

**Forwarding**

Uses forwarding table populated by the probes and automata for forwarding decisions. Example 1, node B to D, can go B-D or B-C-D, because metric for B-C-D is 0.2 < 0.3 of B-D, selects B-C-D.  Example 2, for node A, metric of A-B-D is larger, but the automata says `if ABD then 0` < 0.4 of A-C-D, selects A-B-D.

**Probes**

[D0 is a destination node, B0 and A1 are source nodes]

D0 initializes and sends probes with performance metrics, and the probes will be sent subsequently to the sources. Nodes along the way can know the path metrics based on information received and update forwarding table of its own and the probe to inform path condition change to its neighbors.

####Challenges:

+ Transient loop in arbitrary topology: bc the algorithm is distance-vector + probes traversal takes time, asynchronous updates can cause loops (whereas fat-tree is tree-based, no loops by nature)
  + See **version number** in probes to forced synchronization. e.g. probes 1 will not be used when probes 2 arrives regardless of their arrival time
  + Probes cannot be sent too frequently as it will cause some nodes using newer probes, some use older probes. Limit probes sending rate to at least 0.5RTT to ensure old probes are propagated through whole pathway before sending new probes.
+ Out-of-order delivery:
  + Use **flowlet switching** to group packets in the same flow to avoid reordering at the receiver (work done by [FLARE](https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/multimedia/documents/technical-publication/dynamic-load-balancing-without-packet-reordering-technical-publication.pdf))
  + Introduces looping because flowlet switching entries expire at different times, could form loops occasionally: count hops to monitor loops (distance-vector)
  + Introduces policy violation because flowlet switching is constraint oblivious: add PG tags (policy) to flowlet entry so that flowlet becomes aware of the policy
+ Constraint violation: because of loops + path metrics updates, could violate hard coded constraint (go through firewall...)
  + Use Merlin to compute a *product graph* from automata (policies) and topology with probes and **tags**. In PG, tag represents the state of the automata (policy). At switch, tags will be checked to enforce global user policy.



#### Eval

Fat-tree topo:

Fig9: asymmetric fat-tree with failed link

metrics: FCT, task completion time

Arbitrary topo:

Hula/Conga will not work, beats SPAIN

left = fast, up = more -> upleft means short latency

left = load balanced, up = more -> upleft means good balancing
